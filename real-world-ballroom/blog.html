                            For myself, developing in tech has always been a lifelong desire. Developing and creating content for the Internet has intrigued me since I was a young person. Another lifelong passion of mine has been service. Providing a service that is useful to someone else has been my mission in my working life since day one. I started out my working experiences in the service industry and have always cleaved closely to opportunities to provide for others. Whether it be in a restaurant, a store, a volunteer effort, or troubleshooting technical issues at my day job - being a dependable source of help has been my directive. But what about creating content? Where did that desire go missing in my life path? For a variety of reasons my focus on developing content for the Internet was not realized.

                            It wasn't until I decided to make a new path for myself in 2021, after meeting my soon-to-be wife and being inspired to return to school and finish my degree in tech, that I reignited my passion for developing content for 'the web'. Marrying my passion for tech and my desire to provide a useable service, I stepped out on my own path. I am putting forth my efforts to bring local businesses into the modern era of business. In a world where nearly everyone is constantly connected to outside sources of information it is crucial now more than ever for companies to invest in getting recognized, and producing a viable product for their brand. We at SurfTurkey have decided to make it our utmost goal to develop content for the businesses that would benefit from the services that we will deliver.
